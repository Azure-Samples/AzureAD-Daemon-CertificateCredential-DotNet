# Authenticating to Azure AD in daemon apps with certificates

This sample is similar to Daemon-DotNet, except instead of the daemon using a password as a credential to authenticate with Azure AD, it uses a certificate.

For more information about how the protocols work in this scenario and other scenarios, see [Authentication Scenarios for Azure AD](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=394414).

## How To Run This Sample

To run this sample you will need:
- Visual Studio 2013
- The makecert.exe utility from the Windows SDK
- An Internet connection
- An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. For more information on how to get an Azure AD tenant, please see [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/) 

### Step 1:  Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

`git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-daemon-certificate-credential.git`

### Step 2:  Register the sample with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There are two projects in this sample.  Each needs to be separately registered in your Azure AD tenant.

#### Register the TodoListService web API

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. On the top bar, click on your account and under the **Directory** list, choose the Active Directory tenant where you wish to register your application.
2. Click on **More Services** in the left hand nav, and choose **Azure Active Directory**.
3. Click on **App registrations** and choose **Add**.
4. Enter a friendly name for the application, for example 'TodoListService' and select 'Web Application and/or Web API' as the Application Type. For the sign-on URL, enter the base URL for the sample, which is by default `https://localhost:44321`. For the App ID URI, enter `https://<your_tenant_name>/TodoListService`, replacing `<your_tenant_name>` with the name of your Azure AD tenant. Click on **Create** to create the application.
5. While still in the Azure portal, choose your application, click on **Settings** and choose **Properties**.
6. Find the Application ID value and copy it to the clipboard.

#### Register the TodoListDaemonWithCert app


1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. On the top bar, click on your account and under the **Directory** list, choose the Active Directory tenant where you wish to register your application.
2. Click on **More Services** in the left hand nav, and choose **Azure Active Directory**.
3. Click on **App registrations** and choose **Add**.
4. Enter a friendly name for the application, for example 'TodoListDaemonWithCert' and select *'Web Application and/or Web API'* as the Application Type (even if here we have a console application). 
5. Since this application is a daemon and not a web application, it doesn't have a sign-in URL or app ID URI.  For these two fields, enter "http://TodoListDaemonWithCert". Click on **Create** to create the application.
6. While still in the Azure portal, choose your application, click on **Settings** and choose **Properties**.
7. Find the Application ID value and copy it to the clipboard.


#### Create a self-signed certificate

To complete this step you will need the makecert.exe and, which is included in the Windows SDK.  You may have installed the Windows SDK with Visual Studio, in which case you will find it if you search your computer for makecert.exe.  If not, you can download the SDK [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/desktop/aa904949).  You only need to install the Windows Software Development Kit part of the SDK.  You can find more information about the makecert.exe utility [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bfsktky3(v=vs.110).aspx).

Run makecert.exe with the following parameters to create a self-signed certificate on your computer:

```
makecert -r -pe -n "CN=TodoListDaemonWithCert" -ss My -len 2048 TodoListDaemonWithCert.cer
```

When prompted, create a password for the certificate and remember it for later.  

#### Add the certificate as a key for the TodoListDaemonWithCert application in Azure AD

Open powershell and navigate to the directory where you created your new certificate.  Use the following powershell commands to generate a `$base64Value`, a `$base64Thumbprint`, and a `$keyid` that you can use to upload your cert to Azure AD:

```
$cer = New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2
$cer.Import("TodoListDaemonWithCert.cer")
$bin = $cer.GetRawCertData()
$base64Value = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($bin)
$bin = $cer.GetCertHash()
$base64Thumbprint = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($bin)
$keyid = [System.Guid]::NewGuid().ToString()
```

To associate the certificate credential with the TodoListDaemonWithCert app object in Azure AD, you will need to make use of the application manifest.  In the Azure Management Portal app registration for the `TodoListDaemonWithCert`, click **Manage Manifest** --> **Download Manifest** in the bottom drawer.

Open the manifest if your favorite text editor, and replace the `keyCredentials` property with your new certificate information from above, using the following schema:

```
"keyCredentials": [
    {
        "customKeyIdentifier": "$base64Thumbprint_from_above",
        "keyId": "$keyid_from_above",
        "type": "AsymmetricX509Cert",
        "usage": "Verify",
        "value":  "$base64Value_from_above"
    }
],
```

Save the edits to the application manifest, and upload it back into Azure AD by clicking **Manage Manifest** --> **Upload Manifest**.  Note that the `keyCredentials` property is multi-valued, so you may upload multiple certificates for richer key managemnent.


### Step 3:  Configure the sample to use your Azure AD tenant

#### Configure the TodoListDaemon project

1. Open `app.config'.
2. Find the app key `ida:Tenant` and replace the value with your AAD tenant name.
3. Find the app key `ida:ClientId` and replace the value with the Client ID for the TodoListDaemonWithCert app registration from the Azure portal.
4. Find the app key `ida:CertName` and replace the value with the subject name of the self-signed certificate you created, e.g. "CN=TodoListDaemonWithCert".
5. Find the app key `todo:TodoListResourceId` and replace the value with the  App ID URI of the TodoListService, for example `https://<your_tenant_name>/TodoListService`
6. Find the app key `todo:TodoListBaseAddress` and replace the value with the base address of the TodoListService project.

#### Configure the TodoListService project

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2013.
2. Open the `web.config` file.
3. Find the app key `ida:Tenant` and replace the value with your AAD tenant name.
4. Find the app key `ida:Audience` and replace the value with the App ID URI you registered earlier, for example `https://<your_tenant_name>/TodoListService`.
5. Find the app key `ida:ClientId` and replace the value with the Client ID for the TodoListService from the Azure portal.

### Step 4:  Trust the IIS Express SSL certificate

Since the web API is SSL protected, the client of the API (the web app) will refuse the SSL connection to the web API unless it trusts the API's SSL certificate.  Use the following steps in Windows Powershell to trust the IIS Express SSL certificate.  You only need to do this once.  If you fail to do this step, calls to the TodoListService will always throw an unhandled exception where the inner exception message is:

"The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel."

To configure your computer to trust the IIS Express SSL certificate, begin by opening a Windows Powershell command window as Administrator.

Query your personal certificate store to find the thumbprint of the certificate for `CN=localhost`:

```
PS C:\windows\system32> dir Cert:\LocalMachine\My


    Directory: Microsoft.PowerShell.Security\Certificate::LocalMachine\My


Thumbprint                                Subject
----------                                -------
C24798908DA71693C1053F42A462327543B38042  CN=localhost
```

Next, add the certificate to the Trusted Root store:

```
PS C:\windows\system32> $cert = (get-item cert:\LocalMachine\My\C24798908DA71693C1053F42A462327543B38042)
PS C:\windows\system32> $store = (get-item cert:\Localmachine\Root)
PS C:\windows\system32> $store.Open("ReadWrite")
PS C:\windows\system32> $store.Add($cert)
PS C:\windows\system32> $store.Close()
```

You can verify the certificate is in the Trusted Root store by running this command:

`PS C:\windows\system32> dir Cert:\LocalMachine\Root`

### Step 5:  Run the sample

Clean the solution, rebuild the solution, and run it.  You might want to go into the solution properties and set both projects as startup projects, with the service project starting first.

The daemon will add items to its To Do list and then read them back.

## How To Deploy This Sample to Azure

Coming soon.

## About The Code

If you've looked at the code in this sample and are wondering how authorization works, you're not alone.  See [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34415348/azure-active-directory-daemon-client-using-certificates/).  The TodoList Service in this solution simply validates that the client was able to authenticate against the tenant that the service is configured to work with.  Effectively, any application in that tenant will be able to use the service.

## How To Recreate This Sample

First, in Visual Studio 2013 create an empty solution to host the  projects.  Then, follow these steps to create each project.

### Creating the TodoListService Project

1. In the solution, create a new ASP.Net MVC web API project called TodoListService and while creating the project, click the Change Authentication button, select Organizational Accounts, Cloud - Single Organization, enter the name of your Azure AD tenant, and set the Access Level to Single Sign On.  You will be prompted to sign-in to your Azure AD tenant.  NOTE:  You must sign-in with a user that is in the tenant; you cannot, during this step, sign-in with a Microsoft account.
2. In the `Models` folder add a new class called `TodoItem.cs`.  Copy the implementation of TodoItem from this sample into the class.
3. Add a new, empty, Web API 2 controller called `TodoListController`.
4. Copy the implementation of the TodoListController from this sample into the controller.  Don't forget to add the `[Authorize]` attribute to the class.
5. In `TodoListController` resolving missing references by adding `using` statements for `System.Collections.Concurrent`, `TodoListService.Models`, `System.Security.Claims`.

### Creating the TodoListDaemon Project

1. In the solution, create a new Windows --> Console Application called TodoListDaemon.
2. Add the (stable) Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) NuGet, Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory, version 1.0.3 (or higher) to the project.
3. Add  assembly references to `System.Net.Http`, `System.Web.Extensions`, and `System.Configuration`.
4. Add a new class to the project called `TodoItem.cs`.  Copy the code from the sample project file of same name into this class, completely replacing the code in the file in the new project.
5. Copy the code from `Program.cs` in the sample project into the file of same name in the new project, completely replacing the code in the file in the new project.
6. In `app.config` create keys for `ida:AADInstance`, `ida:Tenant`, `ida:ClientId`, `ida:CertName`, `todo:TodoListResourceId`, and `todo:TodoListBaseAddress` and set them accordingly.  For the public Azure cloud, the value of `ida:AADInstance` is `https://login.windows.net/{0}`.

Finally, in the properties of the solution itself, set both projects as startup projects.
